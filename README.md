# YNAB-Venmo integration

I used YNAB to track my finances and can't live without it. I often use Venmo to split transactions between friends, but I have to manually enter all transactions. Venmo discontinued its API in 2016, so an API connection directly between the two services is impossible. 
To work around this, I set up an email address that all my Venmo notifications are forwarded to. Every night, a job runs to import all new emails into YNAB. 

## To Run

`conda activate ynabvenmo`

## First-Time Installation
